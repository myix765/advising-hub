The course provides continuity throughout the course of medical or veterinary school, allowing each student to develop a mentoring relationship with at least two faculty members. The course is designed in part to ameliorate the potential perceptions of discontinuity created by the spreading out of an 18 month curriculum over 4 years. The course is designed to help prepare a student for the Applied Learning Experience (ALE) and to increase the likelihood that the ALE will be of sufficient scope, depth and quality to allow for a final paper suitable for publication.",

The focus on research examines culture as a contextual influence on human development and briefly addresses issues in conducting culturally sensitive research, including theory, methodology, analyses and interpretation. With various media, primarily audio-visual, the focus on practice will examine specific cultural constructs (e.g., race, ethnicity, religiosity) and their impact on interpersonal interactions.

While randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for establishing treatment efficacy, RWE offers many advantages including the availability of timely data at reasonable cost, large sample sizes that enable analysis of subgroups and rare outcomes, and increased generalizability to real-world clinical practice and more representative patients. Enthusiasm for RWE is tempered by concerns including those related to misclassification or data quality, the lack of randomization and other biases, and spurious data-driven findings. This course will introduce the foundational study designs and analytic approaches that are integral to the valid and efficient analysis of RWE, including those relevant to ‚Äúbig data.‚Äù RWE frameworks and approaches to be discussed will include limiting bias in observational big data, harnessing RWE for predictive analytics, identification of heterogeneity of treatment effects, pragmatic trial designs and the role of RWE for various stakeholders, including regulators. The potential role of RWE for the regulatory approval of novel therapies will also be discussed. Topics will be illustrated through the use of contemporary case studies representing both the promise and limitations of using RWE to inform healthcare decision making.",

The world‚Äôs oceans also present a myriad of opportunities and challenges in international affairs, such as territorial disputes, opening Arctic sea routes, piracy, terrorism, strained fisheries, mineral and energy extraction, marine disasters, whaling, maritime security and technological advances in maritime domain awareness.

    "description": "Taught jointly by faculty from the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and the Feinstein International Center, this course offers insight into the complex issues involved in humanitarian work and provides training in the practical field skills needed to engage in effective responses. Key topics include: humanitarian community and history; sphere standards; rapid assessments; humanitarian clusters: protection; shelter; camp coordination and management; food security; early recovery; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health; nutrition; education; logistics; and emergency telecommunications; program design, budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation; field security; civil-military relations; media skills; mental health and responder resilience; localization and diversity; ethics and accountability. Over the semester, the course will also explore questions about how the current model of humanitarianism needs to evolve in a changing world. It culminates with a mandatory, three-day intensive field simulation. The fee to cover camping gear, food, and other equipment is still to be determined, but in past years has been in the range of USD 300.",

While this return highlights the extreme risks of famine, particularly in conflict-affected areas, it also raises again the limited progress made in addressing the \nunderlying causes of severe food insecurity. ‚ÄúResilience‚Äù has been the good word of the decade, but limited \n\nprogress has been made in building greater resilience among the poorest or most marginalized populations, and the livelihoods of these populations are under more stress now than ever. This class will draw primarily on the international experience of the co-leaders but will attempt to draw on domestic US cases as well.

    "description": "The contemporary challenges arising from global environmental change, such as climate change, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, freshwater scarcity, toxic contamination and energy scarcity, are important issues for scholars from not only the natural and social but also the human sciences. As a result of increasing concerns about global environmental change, over the last decade a new scientific field of research has emerged, the Environmental Humanities (EH). Whereas scholarship on issues of environmental change was formerly dominated by the natural, economic and social sciences ‚Äî and by technological approaches to problem-solving ‚Äî this relatively new and rapidly growing field is constituted by the work of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines within the Humanities, including history, literature, philosophy, cultural studies, religion studies, arts, architecture, and linguistics. These scholars are investigating how the human and human agency are to be understood in the age of the Anthropocene ‚Äìthe era in which humans have become a geological force with devastating potential (Croetzen and Stoermer, 2000). Emergent transdisciplinary fields, such as the environmental humanities and global health, reflect a growing awareness that responses to contemporary environmental dilemmas require the collaborative work of not only diverse scientists, medical practitioners, and engineers, but also more expansive publics, including artists, urban and rural communities, social scientists, and legal fields. Environmental Humanities thus marks an effort to explore and channel the creative synergy that is possible when scholars from the humanities, social sciences, and sciences talk across disciplines about the environment and environmental problems. Central to our concerns are the unequal access to resources as well as the unequal exposure to risk during a period of widening economic disparity. The readings in this course have been selected to help us discuss questions that span the disciplines and the globe: What does it mean to be human in a time of global environmental change? What should environmental ethics look like? How are political, social, and economic structures‚Äîand inequities‚Äîintertwined with ecological realities? How has our understanding of the relationship between culture and nature shaped our conservation efforts? How do our concepts of nature and of environmentalism need to change in response to our current situation? Scholars in the environmental humanities ask and seek to answer these questions, and to develop more equitable ecologies.",

From China‚Äôs nationalist project, the far-right ethnonationalist parties destabilizing Europe, environmental nationalism in climate change debates, to the specter of lost nationhood in the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, nationalism is everywhere. Yet nationalism is an idea and phenomenon that suffers from many misconceptions. This course will survey the major debates and questions within nationalism studies. What is a nation? How does it differ from an ethnic community? Why is nationalism sometimes utterly destructive and other times invaluably constructive? Is strong nationalism more compatible with authoritarian regimes? We will answer such questions from the primary lens of comparative politics, using theories and cases drawn from across the world. By the end of the course, you will have a strong grasp of nationalism as an ever-shifting political force and be able to critically discuss both its powers and pitfalls.",

A wide array of actors, including governments, states, organizations as well as informal actors seek to shape conflict outcomes and intervene at different stages of the conflict resolution (CR) process. Against this backdrop, how do these actors‚Äô strategies compete, interact, and intersect at the same time? The course examines the changing nature of multilateral conflict management. It offers a range of case studies that explore multi-actor interventions in violent/armed conflict, negotiations in peace processes, and multi-scalar peacebuilding initiatives etc. Additionally, it reflects on the role that organizations such as the European Union (the EU), the Arab League (LAS), the African Union (AU) and UN agencies can play in the management of geopolitical conflicts. The course offers a variety of interactive activities, such as in-class discussions, group work, guest lectures and a final role-playing exercise in which students simulate ‚Äòfog and friction‚Äô in a conflict scenario rooted in a real-world event.",

    "description": "Corruption is one of the main political pathologies that can undermine government transparency and therefore limit the ability of government to represent and deliver for citizens. It exists in all countries to varying degrees, and is endemic in post-communist Eastern and Central Europe and Eurasia - in part due to the way former state assets were privatized in the 1990s - and though it can be a mainly domestic phenomenon, it contributes to malign foreign influence as well. Corruption erodes public trust and has affected negatively not only the consolidation of democratic institutions, but in some cases the ability to form a functional government at all or to know who is driving government decision making and on the basis of what interests. Corruption and kleptocracy in the region also have fueled domestic and international conflicts and have impacted European, American, and global security. In this seminar-format course, taught by a practitioner who has served as the National Security Council Director for Central Europe and the Balkans, students will examine the roots, mechanisms, and consequences of corruption and kleptocracy, and will seek to understand some of the available tools to counter them (including, i.a., sanctions, law enforcement, financial transparency initiatives, investigative journalism, and international relations tools such as the EU accession process). They will read case studies from Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and the Balkans, analyze and compare these cases, and discuss the adequacy of citizens‚Äô and the international community‚Äôs attempts to address them thus far. Each student will also write a final paper examining a country or situation and proposing responses to mitigate or eliminate corruption and its consequences in that case.",

    "description": "This is a seminar-style course to introduce students to the concept of water security. Water security is a relatively new term in the field of water science and policy, and it is a concept with multiple interpretations. One definition by the Global Water Partnership is ‚ÄúWater Security, at any level from the household to the global, means that every person has access to enough safe water at an affordable cost to lead a clean, healthy, and productive life while ensuring that the natural environment is protected and enhanced.‚Äù Since the early 2000s, the term has been used in increasing popularity often as justification or informing technical or policy solutions to the world‚Äôs water challenges. How the term is applied in these situations depends on its interpretation, making a solid understanding of the underlying concepts of water security important for decision-makers. Ultimately, water security is a concept that allows us to consider the risks associated with water, such as the risk of a lack of access, risk of poor quality, or risk of flood, and to develop solutions to address these risks, thereby ensuring one‚Äôs water security. However, water security is often conflated with the idea of securitization, which has the potential to encourage a securitized approach to water resources management, when interdependence and cooperation are often what is needed to ensure water security for all. This course will take a deep dive into the main concepts and theories underlying the term water security. We will use the Web of Water Security (Zeitoun 2011) as a framework for understanding how water relates to climate, energy, food, human, and national securities, plus consider the economics of water and address environmental water needs. This course aims to help students build an understanding of water security as a concept so that they can use it as a tool to evaluate and inform sustainable and equitable water solutions to the global water crisis we are currently facing.",

    "description": "21st century challenges to U.S. intelligence are being influenced by two different security and conflict contexts. The first appeared in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. As peacetime turned into wartime, intelligence institutions were tasked with combating new threats posed by transnational, decentralized and networked armed groups. This had a significant impact on the kinds of intelligence methods and capabilities that were could meet these challenges, which differed from those employed against 20th century state threats. The second context is what has been characterized as the new era of ‚Äúgreat-power competition.‚Äù For U.S. intelligence agencies this means that states will be the predominant target in years ahead, relegating nonstate armed groups to a secondary concern.\n\nTo meet the challenges emanating from each of these security contexts, the U.S. intelligence community (IC) has sought to adapt how intelligence is collected, analyzed, and disseminated, as well as how it is employed as an instrument to help achieve policy objectives. A major theme running through the seminar will be to examine how U.S. intelligence has sought to make the necessary changes to adapt to these different challenges, and the extent to which the practices of the 21st century IC have been and will be affected by dramatic technological changes that may result in a revolution in intelligence affairs (RIA).",

    "courseName": "Introduction to Human Security",
    "description": "Human security is a value proposition. It argues that seeking the security of the individual, as defined by that individual, is at least as important as seeking the security of the state ‚Äì and sometimes more important. Although the term ‚Äúhuman security‚Äù is relatively recent, originating in the 1990s post-Cold War era, the question of whose security is primary, the individual‚Äôs or the state‚Äôs, is seminal in international relations scholarship. The argument revolves around differences of viewpoint on what obligations the state has to its people in terms of providing for their security, and whether individuals have claims beyond the state if/when their security is threatened. In the 1990s in particular, these discussions included expanding the definition of security beyond physical safety (e.g., to include economic, identity, and rights-based dimensions), the recognition that entities other than the state provide for individuals‚Äô security when the state either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, and the need for including vulnerable groups in decision-making about security provision.\n \nHuman security covers a broad range of issues and practices, but they all share three main analytic components: (1) person-centered, focusing on views of security as defined from the ground up rather than top-down; (2) multi-dimensional, requiring both an interdisciplinary approach and one that integrates all voices and perspectives; and (3) preventive, choosing to look at root causes and early indicators to be pro-active rather than reactive to threat. Human security thus provides a powerful lens through which to analyze all threats to the security of individuals and communities.\n\nThe issue areas in which the human security lens in most often applied include: gender-based violence; human trafficking; forced migration; drug policy; civilian protection through human rights or non-violent action; multi-track diplomacy; youth and conflict; financial inclusion; and provision of basic services such as healthcare and education.\n\nIn this course, we will review the critical security and feminist security literature that preceded the development of human security. We then cover the core concepts in human security as outlined above: person-centered, multi-dimensional, and preventive. Under each of these themes, we will introduce relevant skills for building analytic competency and draw upon case studies that illustrate how these analytic approaches have been used in practice. Case studies will be drawn from the issue areas listed above.\n\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on becoming a ‚Äúreflective practitioner,‚Äù with the ability to investigate one‚Äôs own values and assumptions and incorporate the learning from this inquiry into one‚Äôs work.",

These include risks posed to the firm and its stakeholders resulting from such factors, as well as risks posed by the firm to its extended stakeholders. The course is structured as an intermediated seminar, i.e. sessions will be facilitated by lecture slides with active engagement expected. The course will examine key themes and developments in regulation, financial reporting, sustainability assessment (or ratings), investment analysis, and capital sourcing across a range of financial markets and asset types, including public equities, public debt, private equity, and infrastructure. Across asset types, key themes include climate risks and financing climate transition, blended capital and innovations in development finance, and fintech, financial inclusion and democratization. Central to the course design is to examine financial strategies and vehicles as tools to advance sustainability and impact objectives whether at the investor, state, or multinational level. To this end, it will introduce and leverage a variety of analytic tools to understand the basic decision models of sustainable and impact investing.",

    "description": "Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. As such, they challenge the perspective that social and environmental problems could only be addressed by government, multilaterals, and philanthropy and that market investments should only seek financial returns. As the world faces unprecedented challenges, the impact investing market plays a critical role in providing much needed capital and strategic partnerships to help address the world‚Äôs most pressing social and environmental problems. Social issues include access to health care, housing, education, clean water, financial inclusion, and safe work conditions. Environmental challenges include not only climate change, but also biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. This class will focus on impact investing, discerning how it fits among other investing strategies in the broader sustainable investing ecosystem. We will discuss concepts including SRI, ESG, and UN SDGs, debate what is and what is not impact investing, and we will evaluate important tools and resources to measure and manage the social and environmental impact of investments. The format is interactive with a combination of case studies, workshops, lecture, and guest speakers. Goals include: developing fluency on the broader sustainable investing ecosystem, which includes SRI, ESG, UN SDGs, thematic, and impact investing strategies; understanding key characteristics of impact investments and tools to recognize ‚Äúgreen-washing‚Äù or ‚Äúimpact-washing‚Äù; learning the basics of impact management, including industry frameworks, impact measurement tools, different investment vehicles, and best practices.
