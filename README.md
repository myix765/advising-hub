REFLECTION
<What motivated your team to choose this project?>
Tufts SIS **sucks**. Every Tufts student knows the frustration of navigating SIS, consulting multiple advisors, and relying on a messy Google Sheet just to understand what’s needed to graduate. The system is convoluted, making it difficult for students and advisors to stay aligned on student goals. Not to mention the added pressure of class enrollment season and the challenge of tracking requirements. We knew there had to be a better way—so we built Alice.

<Potential future work/improvements?>
Improve frontend architecture and comments for code readability/modularity.

<What is a challenge you encountered while making this?>
User experience: Designing an interface that is both easy to navigate while displaying necessary information.

<What is a fun or interesting experience you had with another hacker?>
Talking about when the snacks were going to come out.
